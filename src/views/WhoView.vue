    <h1>Who we are</h1>
    <p class="text-3xl">
      CMA was started by churches together in Fareham<br />
      We're a group of Christians who believe, even in the most difficult of
      times, there is hope for the future. We want to share that hope with
      anyone struggling with debt in the Fareham and Gosport area.
